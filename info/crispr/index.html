    <h1>CRISPR</h1>

    <p>CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. Each word has the following meaning:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Clustered:</strong> The repeated DNA sequences are grouped together and found in close proximity in clusters within the genome rather than being scattered randomly throughout the genome.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Regularly Interspaced:</strong> Between the repeats, there are regularly spaced viral sequences called "spacers," which vary in sequence but are uniform in length.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Short:</strong> The repeats are short DNA sequences, around 20-50 base pairs in length.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Palindromic:</strong> The sequence reads the same forward and backward on complementary DNA strands. For example, the sequence "GAATTC" is palindromic because its complement "CTTAAG" reads the same in reverse.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Repeats:</strong> The sequences are repeated multiple times within the cluster. The repeated units are identical or nearly in sequence.</li>
    </ol>

            This part of the DNA is called the CRISPR array. Note how the repeats are "regularly interspaced."

        <p>Together, the name "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats" describes a set of short DNA sequences that are clustered together in the genome, with each repeat being separated by similarly sized spacers and each repeat having a palindromic nature.</p>
    </div>

    <p>These sequences are part of a bacterial and archaea immune system. The spacers between the repeats are derived from the DNA of viruses that previously attacked the bacterium, serving as a genetic "memory" of past infections. When the bacterium reencounters the same virus, the CRISPR system recognizes and targets the viral DNA for destruction, providing immunity.</p>

    <p>The difference between the naming convention CRISPR and CRISPR-Cas is that CRISPR refers only to the genetic sequences (repeats) and spacers that store the "memory" of past viral infections. CRISPR-Cas refers to the entire immune system, including the CRISPR arrays or loci and the Cas proteins that use this information to recognize and cut viral DNA. There are different types of CRISPR-Cas systems, but the best known is Type II with its Cas9 endonuclease: <strong>CRISPR-Cas9</strong>.</p>
